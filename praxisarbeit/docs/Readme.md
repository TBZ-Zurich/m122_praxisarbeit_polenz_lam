# Dokumentation

## Getting Started

We are using jupyter notebook to create our documentation. To habe a working enviroment we recommend opening the jupyter notebook files in VS Code and install the needed extension (`ms-toolsai.jupyter`)

After installing the extension you need to define our server. For this open the `ipynb` file and on the bottom right is a button called `Jupyter Server`. Press this button and enter the following URI: `122.lopo.dev:8888`. It will ask you wether you want to connect the unsecure server. At the moment the connection is not encryptet and all data will be sent in clear text to our server, so dont submit any passwords!
